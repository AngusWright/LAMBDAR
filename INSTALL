#Instructions for the instalation of the R Package LAMBDAR
#

#
# From GitHub via R console
#

#Lambdar can be downloaded Directly from GitHub into your R Library
#To do this, you must have the developer tools installed & loaded.
#To install & load the devtools, inside the R console Run:

install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)

#Then, still in the R console, run:

install_github("LAMBDAR","AngusWright")
library("LAMBDAR")

#NOTE: This may fail if you are missing Dependencies
#See "Dependencies" Section below

#
# From GitHub via Web Browser
#

#####################
#   Download
#####################


#Package is available for download at:

https://github.com/AngusWright/LAMBDAR

#By clicking on the "Download Zip" Option on the lower-right-side of
#the window.

#Once downloaded, unzip the file using your favourite unzip method.
#The unzipped folder will be named 'LAMBDAR-master'

#####################
#   Install
#####################

#The syntax for installing R packages from the command line is
#
# R CMD INSTALL <package folder>
#
#As such, after the download is unzipped, from the folder containing the package directory, run:

R CMD INSTALL LAMBDAR-master

# i.e. if you unzipped the folder in the 'Downloads' directory, run the above command from inside
#      'Downloads'
#
#if this command fails, it is likely because you are missing packages
#that LAMBDAR requires to run (see Dependencies below), or you
#lack sufficient permissions to load the package into the R library.
#Usually this will prompt for loading the package in your personal
#library, which should then be successful. If not, run:

sudo R CMD INSTALL LAMBDAR-master

#This will install the package in the main R library with root permissions.
#Once installed, the package can be loaded from inside the R environment
#using the command

library(LAMBDAR)
