#Instructions for the instalation of the R Package LAMBDAR
#
#####################
#   Download
#####################

#Package is available for download at:

https://github.com/AngusWright/LAMBDAR

#By clicking on the "Download Zip" Option on the lower-right-side of
#the window.

#Once downloaded, unzip the file using your favourite unzip method.
#The unzipped folder will be named 'LAMBDAR-master'

#####################
#   Install
#####################

#The syntax for installing R packages from the command line is
#
# R CMD INSTALL <package folder>
#
#As such, after the download is unzipped, from the folder containing the package directory, run:

R CMD INSTALL LAMBDAR-master

# i.e. if you unzipped the folder in the 'Downloads' directory, run the above command from inside 
#      'Downloads'
#
#if this command fails, it is likely because you are missing packages
#that LAMBDAR requires to run (see Dependencies below), or you
#lack sufficient permissions to load the package into the R library.
#Usually this will prompt for loading the package in your personal
#library, which should then be successful. If not, run:

sudo R CMD INSTALL LAMBDAR-master

#This will install the package in the main R library with root permissions.
#Once installed, the package can be loaded from inside the R environment
#using the command

library(LAMBDAR)


#####################
#   Dependencies
#####################

#In order to install and run LAMBDAR, you will require the additional packages:
#
# > astro
# > magicaxis
# > nortest
# > foreach
# > doParallel
#
#as well as any packages that these depend on themselves.
#To install these packages, in the R terminal, run

install.packages('<package name>', dependencies=TRUE)

#Once all dependant packages are loaded, run the commands to
#install LAMBDAR.
