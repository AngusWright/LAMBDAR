#Instructions for the instalation of the R Package LAMBDAR
#

#
# From GitHub via R console
#

#Lambdar can be downloaded Directly from GitHub into your R Library
#To do this, you must have the developer tools installed & loaded.
#To install & load the devtools, inside the R console Run:

install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)

#Then, still in the R console, run:

install_github("LAMBDAR","AngusWright")
library("LAMBDAR")

#NOTE: This may fail if you are missing Dependencies
#See "Dependencies" Section below

#
# From GitHub via Web Browser
#

#####################
#   Download
#####################


#Package is available for download at:

https://github.com/AngusWright/LAMBDAR

#It can be cloned using git, simply with the command: 

git clone https://github.com/AngusWright/LAMBDAR

#This will generate a clone of the LAMBDAR package in 
#the current directory

#Alternatively it can be installed by 
#clicking on the "Download Zip" Option on 
#the lower-right-side of the github browser window.

#Once downloaded, unzip the file using your favourite unzip method.
#The unzipped folder will be named 'LAMBDAR-master'. You should 
#rename it to 'LAMBDAR'. 

#####################
#   Install
#####################

#The syntax for installing R packages from the command line is
#
# R CMD INSTALL <package folder>
#
#As such, after the download is unzipped, from the folder containing the package directory, run:

R CMD INSTALL LAMBDAR

# i.e. if you unzipped the folder in the 'Downloads' directory, run the above command from inside
#      'Downloads'
#
#if this command fails, it is likely because you are missing packages
#that LAMBDAR requires to run (see Dependencies below), or you
#lack sufficient permissions to load the package into the R library.
#Usually this will prompt for loading the package in your personal
#library, which should then be successful. If not, you may need to 
#install LAMBDAR with root permission by running:

sudo R CMD INSTALL LAMBDAR-master

#Once installed, the package can be loaded from inside the R environment
#using the command

library(LAMBDAR)

#####################
#   Dependencies
#####################

#In order to install and run LAMBDAR, you will require the additional packages:
#
# > astro
# > magicaxis
# > nortest
# > foreach
# > doParallel
# > RANN
# > seqinr
# > matrixStats
#
#as well as any packages that these depend on themselves.

#To install these packages, in the R terminal, run

install.packages('<package name>', dependencies=TRUE)

#There are also two Suggests packages. One is the Cairo 
#plotting package, for nicer PNG and PDF figures. The program 
#will still function as required without this. 
#The second is the EBImage package, which can be installed from 
#Bioconductor using the following commands (within R):

source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("EBImage")

#This package is used when generating apertures from 
#segmentation maps. Without this package, segmented apertures
#will still be usable, but there may be pathalogically bad 
#results in cases when the segmentation map and data map are of 
#_very_ different scales. 

#Once all dependant packages are loaded, run the commands to
#install LAMBDAR.
