#Instructions for the instalation of the R Package LAMBDAR
#
#####################
#   Download
#####################

#Package is available for download at:

https://github.com/AngusWright/LAMBDAR

#By clicking on the "Download Zip" Option on the lower-right-side of
#the window.

#Once downloaded, unzip the file using your favourite unzip method.

#####################
#   Install
#####################

#After download is unzipped, in the directory of the unzipped folder run:

R CMD INSTALL LAMBDAR

#if this command fails, it is likely because you are missing packages
#that LAMBDAR requires to run (see Dependancies below), or you
#lack sufficient permissions to load the package into the R library.
#Usually this will prompt for loading the package in your personal
#library, which should then be successful. If not, run:

sudo R CMD INSTALL LAMBDAR

#This will install the package in the main R library with root permissions.
#Once installed, the package can be loaded from inside the R environment
#using the command

library(LAMBDAR)


#####################
#   Dependancies
#####################

#In order to install and run LAMBDAR, you will require the additional packages:
#
# > astro
# > magicaxis
# > nortest
# > foreach
# > doParallel
#
#as well as any packages that these depend on themselves.
#To install these packages, in the R terminal, run

install.packages('<package name>', dependancies=TRUE)

#Once all dependant packages are loaded, run the commands to
#install LAMBDAR.
